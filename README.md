# Project Title: PrettyMaps Visualization

This project is a simple demonstration of using the `prettymaps` library to create beautiful and customizable maps in Python. We use the library to generate maps for three different locations in the Philippines: University of the Philippines Diliman, Davao City, and Palm Village.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- prettymaps

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install prettymaps
```

### Usage

1. Run the project script:

```
python main.py
```

This will generate a map for Palm Village, Poblacion, Davao City, Davao Region, Philippines. If you want to visualize a different location, you can uncomment the relevant lines in the `main.py` file.
